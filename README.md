# quick_sort

To run:

	gcc -o quick_sort quick_sort.c

	./quick_sort 

Output:

	Unsorted array:  8  1  6  9  6  3  5  2  7  0 
	Sorted array:  0  1  2  3  5  6  6  7  8  9 
	
Look, I know it's hardcoded to only use a stored array. You're a smart boy/girl. Go ahead and finish this up. Command line functionality? Yes, please.
